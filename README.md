Tutorial: https://medium.com/deep-writing/how-to-write-with-artificial-intelligence-45747ed073c
* This tutorial is intended for Mac, so TensorFlow should be installed using the [instructions on the homepage](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_raspbian)

Important note: Due to freezing caused by suspected excessive power draw, these tasks were run via SSH, with HDMI and USB bluetooth mouse disconnected to minimise
power requirements.

Investigate: Possibility of resuming failed jobs
